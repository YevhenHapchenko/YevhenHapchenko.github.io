                    American basketball player Michael Jordan led the Chicago Bulls to six National Basketball Association(NBA)
                    championships (1991–93, 1996–98). He was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player (MVP)
                    five times (1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998) and was also named Defensive Player of the Year in 1988.

                    Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York City, on  February 17, 1963,
                    the son of bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr.
                    In 1968, he moved with his family to Wilmington, North Carolina. Jordan attended  Emsley A. Laney
                    High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and
                    football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year; at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he
                    was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the team.

                        Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team, and tallied some
                        40-point games.
                        The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.
                        Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his
                        final two seasons of high school play. As a senior, he was selected to play in the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and
                        scored 30 points, after averaging 27 ppg, 12 rebounds (rpg), and six assists per game (apg) for the season. Jordan was
                        recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and
                        Virginia. In 1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where
                        he majored in cultural geography.

                    In 1984 Jordan was drafted by the Chicago Bulls. In his first season (1984–85) as a professional,
                    he led the league in scoring and was named Rookie of the Year; after missing most of the following
                    season with a broken foot, he returned to lead the NBA in scoring for seven consecutive seasons, averaging
                    about 33 points per game. He was only the second player (after Wilt Chamberlain) to score 3,000 points in a
                    single season (1986–87). Jordan was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) five times (1988, 1991, 1992,
                    1996, 1998) and was also named Defensive Player of the Year in 1988. In October 1993, after leading the Bulls to
                    their third consecutive championship, Jordan retired briefly and pursued a career in professional baseball.
                    He returned to basketball in March 1995. In the 1995–96 season Jordan led the Bulls to a 72–10 regular
                    season record, the best in the history of the NBA (broken in 2015–16 by the Golden State Warriors).
                    From 1996 to 1998 the Jordan-led Bulls again won three championships in a row, and each time Jordan was
                    named MVP of the NBA finals. After the 1997–98 season Jordan retired again.
