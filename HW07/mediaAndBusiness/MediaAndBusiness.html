                        Jordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history.
                        He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, 
                        Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI. Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade,
                        appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the "Be Like Mike" commercials 
                        in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.

                        Nike created a signature shoe for Jordan, called the Air Jordan, in 1984.
                        One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon.
                        In the commercials, Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became 
                        convinced that "it's gotta be the shoes". The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate 
                        of "shoe-jackings" where people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently, Nike spun off the 
                        Jordan line into its own division named the "Jordan Brand". The company features an impressive list of athletes 
                        and celebrities as endorsers. The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of 
                        North Carolina, UCLA, California, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgetown, and Marquette.

                        In June 2010, Jordan was ranked by Forbes as the 20th-most powerful celebrity in the 
                       world with $55 million earned between June 2009 and June 2010. According to Forbes, Jordan 
                        Brand generates $1 billion in sales for Nike. In June 2014, Jordan was named the first NBA 
                        player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from 
                        80% to 89.5%. On January 20, 2015, Jordan was honored with the Charlotte Business Journal's 
                         Business Person of the Year for 2014. In 2017, he became a part owner of the Miami Marlins of Major 
                        League Baseball. Forbes designated Jordan as the athlete with the highest career earnings in 2017. 
                        From his Jordan Brand income and endorsements, Jordan's 2015 income was an estimated $110 million, 
                        the most of any retired athlete. As of 2022, his net worth is estimated at $1.7 billion by Forbes, 
                        making him the sixth-richest African-American, behind Robert F. Smith, David Steward, Oprah Winfrey, 
                        Kanye West, and Rihanna.

                    <p>
                       Jordan played himself in the 1996 comedy film Space Jam. 
                        The film received mixed reviews, but it was a box office success, making $230 million worldwide, 
                        and earned more than $1 billion through merchandise sales. In 2000, Jordan was the subject of an IMAX 
                        documentary about his career with the Chicago Bulls, especially the 1998 NBA playoffs, entitled Michael Jordan
                        to the Max. Two decades later, the same period of Jordan's life was covered in much greater and more 
                        personal detail by the Emmy Award-winning The Last Dance, a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on ESPN 
                        in April and May 2020. The Last Dance relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordan's and his 
                        teammates' off-court activities which an NBA Entertainment crew had shot over the course of the 1997â€“98 NBA 
                        season for use in a documentary. The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his 
                        permission for the footage to be used. He was interviewed at three homes associated with the production
                        and did not want cameras in his home or on his plane, as according to director Jason Hehir "there are certain 
                        aspects of his life that he wants to keep private". Jordan granted rapper Travis Scott permission to film a 
                        music video for his single "Franchise" at his home in Highland Park, Illinois. Jordan appeared in the 2022 
                        miniseries The Captain, which follows the life and career of Derek Jeter.
